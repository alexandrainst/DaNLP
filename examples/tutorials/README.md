Tutorials
=========

Some of the examples make use of the DaNLP pip package and show how to use the 
package. Other examples focus on different use cases e.g. applying cross-transfer 
learning on Danish. 

### List of currently available tutorials

Jupyter notebooks : 
- Getting started tutorial, including examples of how to load and use DaNLP models and datasets (similar to the code snippets from our [documentation](https://danlp-alexandra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)) : `getting_started.ipynb`
- Tutorial of applying zero shot transfer learning to train a sentiment 
   classifier that can be applied on Danish text:
   `example_zero_shot_sentiment.ipynb`
- Tutorial about how to learn a text classification model, 
    here exemplified by a model that can predict which party a speech 
    (from the Danish parliament) belongs to : `example_text_classification.ipynb`
- Tutorial about how to perform data augmentation on Danish text, 
    here exemplified by augmenting Tweets and testing if the increased data 
    increases the performance of a sentiment model: `example_data_augmentation.ipynb`
- Tutorial about how to build a simple knowledge graph using NER, POS-tagging, 
    dependency parsing and coreference resolution : `example_knowledge_graph.ipynb`
